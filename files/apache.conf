# apache2.conf -- version for puppet-controlled installations
#
# this config file merely sets some important basic configs and
# includes other files; all the truly important stuff is configured in
# one of the include directories.

# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation (available
# at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mpm_common.html#lockfile>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"

# AccessFileName: The name of the file to look for in each directory
# for additional configuration directives.  See also the AllowOverride
# directive.
AccessFileName .htaccess

# The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being
# viewed by Web clients.
<Files ~ "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a
# document if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename
# extensions.  If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents,
# "text/plain" is a good value.  If most of your content is binary,
# such as applications or images, you may want to use
# "application/octet-stream" instead to keep browsers from trying to
# display binary files as though they are text.
DefaultType text/plain

# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.  This needs to be set in
# /etc/apache2/envvars
PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}

# These need to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
User ${APACHE_RUN_USER}
Group ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}

# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
HostnameLookups Off

# Log errors to the right place
ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log

# Include module configuration:
